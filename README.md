## üìñ About Brevio

Welcome to the **Brevio**. This mobile app, built with React Native and Expo, takes advantage of powerful AI capabilities to provide insights from large documents and any related image with text. The application is adaptable and can work in any language, including handwriting and upside down text. Avoid spending hours reading a document that may not be relevant to your research. Scan in and determine in seconds if the document is for you by receiving a brief summary of the document.

## üß† About the Project

This project had an open brief that required the use of open-source AI. For my project, I created a scanning app that gives users a brief summary of their documents. To accomplish this, I used two AI models to help extract and summarise text from images, resulting in efficient document insights.

- **[Google Vision]:** This AI is in charge of image recognition and is capable of extracting the words from the image and displaying them in back for the user.
- **[OpenAI]:** This AI is in charge of taking the extracted words and turning them into a summary. so that the user can easily read what the document is about.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **React Native** - For cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo** - To streamline development and simplify testing

  - **File System** - To handle file operations within the app
- **Axios** - For making HTTP requests to APIs
- **Firebase** - Backend-as-a-Service for app data management and authentication
  - **Firestore** - For storing user document data
  - **Firebase Auth** - For handling user authentication
- **react-native-config** - For managing environment variables securely
- **Custom Image Upload Service** - To handle uploading images to cloud storage
